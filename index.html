        <b><div id="p"> <p>Im excited to show what I've learned throughout the past month as a self 
taught developer. Now, everything may be great starting off for a while. But when it's time 
to start writing code on your own without turtorials, it's a living hell (Well for me anyway)
. <p>But I had to realize that even though its very tough and stressful, I would rather keep 
pushing through the hard times, scrapping by to get information and struggle to write simple 
lines of code, then to walk away. If you really want to code, especially teaching your self, 
you're going to want to walk away and hang it up. <p>When you have thoughts like that, it's 
scary because myself is guilty of this. But my love and passion to want to be better and 
always enjoying learning something new out-weighed the mental doubt and imposter syndrome 
that I feel everyday, even when just thinking about code I believe I don't deserve to even 
think about it. </p>

<h2>So What's Next?  </h2
 <p>Well it's pretty obvious that I am going to keep practicing cooding everyday so I can better my 
skills and knowledge. So that by this time next year I will have my first Developer job. As 
unrealistic as that may seem right now, due to the fact im struggling with html and css. <p>But 
i've never in my life felt more complete with anything until I started learning about programming. 
The goal is to better my Html and CSS skills to where I can easily make a web page/site without 
erasing everything I make. <p>Than finally, I can learn JavaScript. Just the few basics with 
console.log(), alert() and document.write(), the basics already are realy fun but are complex for 
me. Even though its been only a month, I love codind and I will NEVER stop improving my skills.</p>
